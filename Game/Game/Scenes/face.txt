Hello friend. I am happy to see you.
Line break, perhaps?

.
This is first option.
#
%
GOTO 1
#
.
This is second option.
#
%
GOTO 2
NEEDS TEST 1 MORE
NEEDS TEST2 2 LESS
#
.
And the third option.
#
%
GOTO 3
#
.
Maybe you'd prefer this instead?
#
%
GOTO 4
#
.
Filler option number 1
#
%
GOTO 2
#
.
Filler option numero second.
I could even make it cool like this.
#
%
GOTO 2
#
!
/Option 1 below

You have reached option 1.
#
.
Go back to start.
#
%
GOTO 0
#

/Option 2 below

You have reached option 2.
#

Continue
#
%
GOTO 3
#
.
Go back to start.
#
%
GOTO 0
#

/Option 3

.
You got to option 3! :D
#
.
Go back to start.
#
%
GOTO 0
#
!
/Option 4
!
.
This is the fourth option.
To be honest, I'm not sure why you're here.
Isn't it cool, though?
#
.
Go back to start.

GOTO 0

Exit this dialogue tree (overworld!).
